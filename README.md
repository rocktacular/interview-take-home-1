You must create a `/.env.local` file (at the root) that contains your TMDB API key.

```
REACT_APP_TMDB_API_URL = "<your api key>"
```

This key is accessed as `process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_API_URL` in **src/services/TMDB.js**. See the [Docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) for details.

## Assignment (Take Home)

This was a take-home test for an interview for a front-end position. You are given 3 days to complete it.

### Requirements
1. List top X movies from YYYY year in descending order of score
2. Include thumbnail image, score, release date, and details link
3. Details link should navigate to separate page that shows the above plus overview text
4. User should be able to favorite/unfavorite on Details page
5. Favorite/unfavorite should persist through one load of the app
6. Given some wireframes, follow general layout structure

Here's a screenshot of what I ended up with.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
